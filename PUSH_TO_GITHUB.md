# Push to GitHub Instructions

Your code is ready and committed locally! Follow these steps to push to GitHub:

## Steps:

### 1. Create a new repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right
3. Click **"New repository"**
4. Repository name: `BodaxGamingWeb` (or whatever you prefer)
5. Description: "BodaxGaming team website with React and Firebase"
6. Choose **Public** or **Private**
7. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
8. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Push your code

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BodaxGamingWeb.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Alternative: One command to do it all

If you want, I can help you install GitHub CLI which lets you create and push in one go:

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
gh repo create BodaxGamingWeb --public --source=. --push
```

Your local git repository is ready with all files committed!
