## âœ… What's Already Done

Your website is ready to use! The Firebase configuration is already connected to your project.

## ðŸ”¥ Firebase Setup (Required)

You need to complete these steps in the Firebase Console to make your website fully functional:

### Step 1: Enable Authentication

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: **bodaxgamingweb**
3. Click on **Authentication** in the left menu
4. Click **Get Started** (if not already enabled)
5. Go to **Sign-in method** tab
6. Click on **Email/Password**
7. Enable it and click **Save**

### Step 2: Create Admin User

2. Click **Add user**
3. Enter your email and a strong password
4. Click **Add user**

**Remember these credentials! You'll use them to log into the admin panel.**

### Step 3: Set up Firestore Database

1. Click on **Firestore Database** in the left menu
2. Click **Create database**

   - For production, you'll want to set up proper security rules later
4. Choose a location close to your users (e.g., us-central, europe-west)
5. Click **Enable**

### Step 4: Configure Security Rules (Important!)

Once your database is created:

1. Go to **Firestore Database** â†’ **Rules** tab
2. Replace the rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Anyone can read matches and players
    match /matches/{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /players/{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **Publish**

This allows:
